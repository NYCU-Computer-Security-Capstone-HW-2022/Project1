# Project1
Project 1 in the course.

In this project, we implement the dns amplification attack. 
Also, we use the EDNS mechanism to enlarge our ratio of dns response packet size divided dns request packet size.

## How to set up the project

1. Run our makefile
2. ./a.out <Victim IP> <UDP Source Port> <DNS Server IP> (Remember to use the root privilege to execute program.)
